    <!-- Define percentage-based margins (insets) for the game display area.
         The game will be rendered and centered inside the remaining region,
         automatically preserving its native aspect ratio.

         Supported formats (legacy):
         - "V"           : V% on all sides
         - "V_H"         : V% vertical (top/bottom), H% horizontal (left/right)
         - "T_R_B_L"     : top_right_bottom_left (CSS style)

         Values: 0–99 (percent of screen)
         Rules: top + bottom < 100, left + right < 100

         Examples (for legacy tests):
         - "0"           : no margins (pre-refactor default)
         - "10"          : 10% margin all around (80% area usable)
         - "5_25"        : 5% top/bottom, 25% left/right
         - "5_25_45_25"  : top=5%, right=25%, bottom=45%, left=25%
         - "150"         : invalid value, will be clamped to 99
         - "50_60"       : vertical sum exceeds 100 → automatically clamped

    <!-- Horizonal alignment: left|center|right -->
    <string name="gs_align_horizontal">left</string>

    <!-- Vertical alignment: top|center|bottom -->
    <string name="gs_align_vertical">top</string>

    <!--
         Percentage (0–99) used as an offset margin for the camera hole. When
         non‑zero it reserves space on whichever edge the front camera sits (top
         in portrait, left/right in landscape according to rotation). It is
         ignored when the screen has no camera or the user does not care.
    -->
    <integer name="gs_camera_hole_pct">0</integer>

    <!--
         Separate percentage (0–99) used to apply alignment offset regardless
         of camera.  This is the value that will move the game area to the left,
         right, top or bottom when gs_align_horizontal/vertical is set.  A
         value of 0 causes alignment to have no visible effect unless a camera
         margin is also present.
    -->
    <integer name="gs_align_offset_pct">0</integer>

    <!--
      Examples of using the new system:
      - h_align="center", v_align="center" → nothing is moved (default)
      - v_align="top", camera_hole_pct="10" → game pushed down 10%
      - h_align="left", camera_hole_pct="5"  → game pushed right 5%
      - h_align="center", camera_hole_pct="5" + landscape & rot90 →
        spacing on the right since the camera will be on that side

      Old `gs_inset_portrait`/`gs_inset_landscape` settings still work for
      legacy APKs but are not emitted in new builds.
